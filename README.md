# Known Issues

Global:
-Some events (Such as getting a perfect score on a song) trigger an easter egg feature which no longer appears to be functional and can cause errors. It's advised to disable this feature in the theme settings for now.

-Style Options are not displayed by song difficulties. They are still selectable, but it is unclear which mode was chosen until the song has been entered. Style does display after completion, but does not update when changing difficulties/styles.

-Video options are currently using the old video options config, need to be updated to new config. Currently, trying to adjust video options while in this theme will crash the game. It is advised to switch to a different them to adjust video options until this is fixed.

-Most Game Modes aside from Dance and Pump do not have style graphics yet.

-Audio settings are ignored, contniually plays at one single volume.

GDGF:
-Notes are too high up on the screen/cut into life bar

-Note presses don't appear to register

Taiko:
-Pressing the "s" and "d" keys on a keyboard to hit the red notes appears to end/auto-clear the song. Both blue keys ("a" and "f") do not do this. Will research further.
