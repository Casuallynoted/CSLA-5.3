# CSLA-5.3
Updated CyberiaStyle theme for OutFox 5.3
Should work with nearly all game modes (aside from ones specified in the "Known Issues" section.

# Known Issues

Global:
-Some events (Such as getting a perfect score on a song) trigger an easter egg feature which no longer appears to be functional and can cause errors. It's advised to disable this feature in the theme settings for now.

-Most Game Modes aside from Dance and Pump do not have style graphics yet. Will show as "Graphic Unavailable" in the top right corner of the music selection screen until an image is present.

GDGF:
-Some noteskins are too high up on the screen/cut into life bar
